  those rows from the other table where the join condition is fulfilled.

   Syntax- SELECT columns  FROM table1  LEFT [OUTER] JOIN table2 ON 
  table1.column = table2.column; 


   3. Right outer join-The MySQL Right Outer Join returns all rows from the RIGHT-hand table (Table 2) specified in the ON condition 
      and only those rows from the other table where he join condition is fulfilled.
